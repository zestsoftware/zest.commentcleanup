Changelog
=========

1.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Added @@find-catalog-comments page (linked from the overview page)
  that finds and catalogs all comments for objects that currently
  allow commenting.  This is needed after a clear and rebuild of the
  portal_catalog, as the catalog then loses all info about comments.
